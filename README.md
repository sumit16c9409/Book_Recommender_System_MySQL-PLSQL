# Book_Recommender_System_MySQL-PLSQL
Book Recommender system using MYSQLand PLSQL 
The aim of the project was to build a database schema which would suffice the functional aspects of an online book recommender system. A structured database will help in organizing the data that needs to be accessed in order to provide recommendations to the user .

The project makes use of the relational MYSQL database system that will form the underlying schema to hold the data for an online Book Recommendation System. The data used for making recommendation is comparatively very less as that expected from an e-commerce system but can provide a basic infrastructure in a way to provide recommendations. The system does not aim at making the full -fledge functional recommender system as the domain is quite restricted in terms of computation or algorithms that are used to provide recommendations.

The recommender system will provide a basic set of functionality in order to make recommendations based on the available data in various tables .The system makes use of various views, stored procedures and queries that can help to generate recommendations which are non-personalized and personalized .Personalized recommendation are the once which are based entirely on the user preferences like the books purchased by the user in the past, the types of books that the user tends to read based on their qualities and the underlying themes like politics, education, romance etc. The non -personalized recommendations are the ones that are derived based on the similarity of a reader with his peers or generic qualities like the age group, gender the reader belongs to.
